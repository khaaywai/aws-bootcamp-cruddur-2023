[Lucid share link for Logical and Conceptual Architecture](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/16491187-a6ab-41d7-b2d6-d748e4b27d42/edit?viewport_loc=-11%2C-61%2C3466%2C1749%2CErfG-OHlmvwR&invitationId=inv_7f320338-67be-4121-b599-4afb2c11fe7f)

While building the chart, I faced a challenge, I couldn't find the momento logo in Lucid shapes. I resolved this by using an online converter to convert a screenshot of the logo to SVG format, and then import the svg file into Lucid.
